# `üêâ bevy-rust-gpu`

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-API-blue)](https://bevy-rust-gpu.github.io/bevy-rust-gpu/bevy_rust_gpu/)

A set of bevy plugins supporting the use of `rust-gpu` crates.

Feature includes hot-reloading, metadata-based entrypoint validation, and hot-recompiling via runtime export of active entrypoints.

## Usage

First, implement a `Material` type to describe your material's bind group layout and pipeline specialization.
The vertex and fragment shaders specified here will be used as the fallback if their `rust-gpu` equivalents are not available,
so can be left to the default `Material` implementation if desired.

Then, implement `RustGpuMaterial` for your `Material` type.
This will require creating marker structs to represent its vertex and fragment shaders,
and implementing the `EntryPoint` trait on them to describe entry point names and compile-time parameters.
(See `src/bevy_pbr_rust.rs` for the `bevy-pbr-rust`-backed `StandardMaterial` reference implementation.)

Next, add `RustGpuPlugin` to your bevy app to configure the backend.
Currently this must occur before `RenderPlugin` is added (most often via `DefaultPlugins`), as it requires early access to `WgpuSettings` to disable storage buffer support.

For each `RustGpuMaterial` implementor, add a `RustGpuMaterialPlugin::<M>` to your app to setup rendering machinery and hot-reload / hot-rebuild support if the respective features are enabled (see below.)

When instantiating `RustGpu` materials, handles to the `Shader` representing your `rust-gpu` SPIR-V will be required.
These handles should be acquired via the `AssetServer::load_rust_gpu_shader` extension method, which is provided by the `LoadRustGpuShader` trait.
This will allow the plugin to automatically load the `.spv.json` metadata asset required for hot-reloading support.

## Feature Flags

### `hot-reload`

Enables hot-reloading support.

Automatically loads the `.spv.json` metadata generated by `rust-gpu` alongside its associated `.spv` file,
and uses it to validate entry points at material specialization time.

This prevents bevy from panicking when an invalid entrypoint is requested, fall back to the default shader,
and re-specialize the material if it becomes available after a reload.

### `hot-rebuild`

Adds the `EntryPointExport` resource, which can be used to retrieve an `ExportHandle` corresponding to a JSON output file.
When passed to a `RustGpu` material, active entrypoints to be aggregated and exported to the corresponding file on change.

This can be used in concert with the `hot-reload` feature, `rust-gpu-builder`'s file watching functionality,
and `permutate-macro`'s static permutation generation to drive a hot-rebuild workflow:

* The bevy app loads a `RustGpu` material, tries to specialize it, and exports the set of required entry points to `entry_points.json`
* `rust-gpu-builder` picks up the change to `entry_points.json` and triggers a recompile
* `permutate-macro` attributes in the target shader crates read `entry_points.json`, and conditionally generate the required entry points
* `rust-gpu` compiles the generated code, outputting `shader.spv` and `shader.spv.json`
* The bevy app picks up the changes to `shader.spv` and `shader.spv.json`, hot-reloads them, and respecializes the material with the now-available entry points
* Repeat as new `RustGpu` materials are loaded by the bevy app

### `bevy-pbr-rust`

Implements `RustGpu` for `StandardMaterial` via the `MeshVertex` and `PbrFragment` entry point markers.
